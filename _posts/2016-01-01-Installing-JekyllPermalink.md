The easiest way to run Jekyll is by using the RubyInstaller for Windows.

Installation via RubyInstallerPermalink
RubyInstaller is a self-contained Windows-based installer that includes the Ruby language, an execution environment, important documentation, and more. We only cover RubyInstaller-2.4 and newer here, older versions need to install the Devkit manually.

Download and Install a Ruby+Devkit version from RubyInstaller Downloads. Use default options for installation.
Open a new command prompt window from the start menu, so that changes to the PATH environment variable becomes effective. Install Jekyll and Bundler via: gem install jekyll bundler
Check if Jekyll installed properly: jekyll -v
That’s it, you’re ready to install our default minimal blog theme with jekyll new jekyll-website.
